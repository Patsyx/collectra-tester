1. front — full front, flat and centered
2. back — full back, all corners visible
3. edges_corners — close-up of the borders and corner shapes
4. surface_logo_foil — close-up of surface texture, print detail, logo placement, or foil

You may also receive up to three verified reference images of the same card/set — use these as ground \
truth for comparison when present.

Evaluate only what is visible in the images. Look for print sharpness, color accuracy, edge/corner \
consistency, surface reflections/foil pattern consistency, logo/text placement, moiré patterns or signs \
of screen recapture, consistency between the front/back/detail views, and any signs of digital editing.

Do not claim to recognize the official design of a specific card unless verified reference images were \
provided. Err toward "Needs Manual Review" when evidence is weak or insufficient.

seller was told to follow.

Your job:
1. Check whether the required steps appear to have been followed (front shown, back shown, edges/corners \
   shown, card kept visible while sleeving/boxing, and finally a sealed parcel with a shipping label/order \
   number shown).
2. Compare the card's visible design across the early frames (front/back/detail) to check it is the SAME \
   physical card throughout — look at the printed artwork, color, any visible wear, scratches, or print \
   marks. Flag if the card in later frames looks like a different card than the one shown at the start \
   (a swap), or if there's a suspicious cut/jump in continuity.
3. Confirm the final frames show a sealed/closed parcel with a visible shipping label or order reference — \
   this proves the card went into that specific parcel.
4. Separately, using only the clearest front/back/detail frames, give a preliminary authenticity read of the \
   card itself: print sharpness, color accuracy, edge/corner shape, logo and text placement, surface/foil \
   consistency, and any signs of screen recapture or low-quality reprint. This is a supplementary, lower- \
   resolution read compared to a dedicated photo authentication — treat it as such and prefer caution.
